To solve the problem efficiently, we need to utilize the Sieve of Eratosthenes to precompute prime numbers up to the largest value in nums and then determine the winner of each round by analyzing the game state based on the rules. Below is the implementation of the isWinner function for the "Prime Game":

Explanation of the Code:
Sieve of Eratosthenes:

This is an efficient algorithm to find all prime numbers up to a given number max_n.
It marks multiples of each prime as non-prime, starting from 2.
Cumulative Prime Count:

Precomputes the count of primes up to each number from 1 to max_n to allow constant-time queries during each round.
Game Logic:

For each n in nums, determine how many primes are available up to n using the precomputed prime_count.
If the count is odd, Maria wins that round (as she plays first and both play optimally). If the count is even, Ben wins.
Result Determination:

After all rounds, compare the total wins of Maria and Ben to determine the overall winner.
Example Walkthrough:
For x = 3 and nums = [4, 5, 1]:

Round 1 (n = 4): Primes = [2, 3], Maria starts. Ben wins.
Round 2 (n = 5): Primes = [2, 3, 5], Maria starts. Maria wins.
Round 3 (n = 1): No primes, Ben wins by default.
Output: "Ben"
